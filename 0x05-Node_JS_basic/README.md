# Node.js Basics

This repository contains a series of exercises to help you understand the fundamentals of Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime environment.

**What is Node.js?**

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's particularly well-suited for building server-side applications, network applications, and real-time applications.

## Key Concepts Covered:

  - **Asynchronous Programming:** Learn how to handle non-blocking operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
  - **File System Operations:** Explore how to read and write files using the `fs` module.
  - **HTTP Server:** Create basic and advanced HTTP servers using the `http` module and Express.js.
  - **Process and Environment Variables:** Work with command-line arguments and environment variables.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to make your applications more resilient.

## Exercises:

1.  **Hello World:** A simple script to print "Hello, World\!" to the console.
2.  **File Reading and Writing:** Read a file, modify its contents, and write it back to disk.
3.  **HTTP Server:** Create a basic HTTP server that responds to requests.
4.  **Express.js Server:** Build a more advanced server using the Express.js framework.
5.  **Asynchronous Operations:** Demonstrate asynchronous programming techniques using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
6.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to catch and handle exceptions.
