# ES6 Promises

### Objective:

This project aims to solidify your understanding of _ES6 promises_ and their applications in _asynchronous programming_.
You'll learn how to 
* create,
* handle,
* and chain promises effectively.

### Concepts:

* Promises: A fundamental concept in JavaScript for representing _asynchronous operations_.
* Promise States: Understand the three states of a promise: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
* then() Method: Chaining promises to handle both successful and failed outcomes.
* resolve() and reject() Methods: Resolving and rejecting promises with specific values.
* catch() Method: Handling rejected promises and errors.
* Promise.all(): Waiting for multiple promises to resolve.
* Promise.race(): Resolving a promise as soon as any of the input promises resolves.
* async/await Syntax: Simplifying asynchronous code using a more synchronous-like approach.
* Error Handling: Using _try...catch_ blocks to handle potential errors.
