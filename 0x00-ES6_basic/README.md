# ES6 Basics (ECMAScript 6)

Enhancements that aimed to make _JavaScript_ more powerful and easier to use.

## Variables and Constants
_let_ and _const_: These keywords provide block-scoped variable declarations, offering more control over variable lifetimes compared to var.

```javascript
let name = "Alice";
const age = 30;```
